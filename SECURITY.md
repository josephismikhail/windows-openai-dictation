# Security and privacy

## Credentials

API keys are stored as a DPAPI blob scoped to the current Windows user, outside the source repository. Other Windows accounts cannot normally decrypt that blob. Software running as your account or with administrative access may still access it; encryption is not protection from a compromised account.

The settings field must remain masked and must not refill with the saved key. Blank input preserves an existing credential. Never put a key in a command-line argument, log, screenshot, issue, or test fixture. The optional key-import command accepts standard input instead of command-line text.

## Audio and network

The microphone is opened only for an explicit recording and is closed on stop, cancel, error, or shutdown. A bounded recording length protects against forgotten sessions. Audio is kept in memory for streaming and fallback, then released. Public tests do not open a real microphone or use an API key.

Recording temporarily mutes active output devices through Windows Core Audio. The app remembers which devices it muted and restores them after capture ends, including cancellation and normal shutdown. It never changes the microphone volume or output volume levels. Forced termination cannot run cleanup, so manual unmuting may be needed after a crash.

Production requests go directly to `api.openai.com` over TLS. No project server, telemetry collector, analytics SDK, or automatic update service is present. Response bodies and transcripts must not appear in error logs. Error messages should describe the failure without including credentials or private dictation.

`last-error.json` stores only the latest safe error message, stage, exception type names, and HRESULT values in the current user's local application-data folder. It excludes exception messages from unexpected failures, stack traces, provider bodies, audio, clipboard content, and credentials. Failure to write this diagnostic must not interfere with cleanup or error display.

OpenAI receives the audio and cleanup inputs. Its account terms and retention policies apply. `store: false` is a request option, not a claim of zero retention.

## Keyboard and clipboard

The app registers a global keyboard hook for Ctrl+Alt+Space, and Escape while a session is active. It must not log ordinary keystrokes. Insertion requires the captured destination window and field to be active. If focus moved, the app attempts to restore only the original field and selection, verifying its process/runtime identity, editable state, and unchanged contents. Unknown or read-only providers, changed text, unavailable fields, or denied foreground activation go to recovery. The app never synthesizes an Enter key or sends messages.

To verify a returning editor, the app may read up to 200,001 characters locally through Windows UI Automation and retains only a SHA-256 fingerprint plus the original selection range for that session. Fields exceeding 200,000 characters are not restored automatically. This editor content and fingerprint are not included in OpenAI requests, written to logs, or persisted. Unsupported providers keep ordinary same-field insertion available; when focus has changed, their transcript is shown in a local recovery window instead.

Paste temporarily puts cleaned text on the clipboard. The previous clipboard is restored if the app still owns the temporary value; a new clipboard value must not be overwritten. Clipboard managers and Windows history operate independently of this application.

Windows can advertise an empty `EnterpriseDataProtectionId` marker that its managed clipboard API cannot read. The snapshot may omit that empty marker only when the read fails with `CLIPBRD_E_BAD_DATA` (or returns null) and Windows explicitly reports no enterprise ID. An unavailable protection check, a protected clipboard, other unreadable formats, or access-denied errors still fail closed. The app never changes enterprise protection policy or removes a meaningful label.

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities without including a working key, private audio, or private text. If a key is accidentally disclosed, revoke it in OpenAI Platform immediately. Review every diff before publishing, including fixtures, screenshots, and generated files.
